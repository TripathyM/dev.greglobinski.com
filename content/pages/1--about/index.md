### Who am I?

My name is Greg. I am a front-end web developer. I love GatsbyJS. Before we met I had been living in the land of Wordpress, Drupal, SASS and jQuery. GatsbyJS introduced me to a complete new world of ReactJS, ES6+, CSS in JS, Babel, Webpack and I like it.

### What is it about?

This blog is an educational project.

I have created a few GatsbyJS starters and websites already. Every time I create a new one I learn many new things. They say that the best way to solidify newly acquired knowledge is to teach it to somebody. That is what I am aiming at.

I will share with you what I have learnt. I expect that will strengthen my understanding of subjects I will write about. I also hope that you find it helpful.

So once again, it is an eductional project. For sure for me, but chances are for you also. :)

### The English language

One more thing, I'm not a native English speaker so you may find some mistakes in my writings. Source code of this website is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/greglobinski/dev.greglobinski.com), if you want to correct something you can make a pull request. Thank you.
